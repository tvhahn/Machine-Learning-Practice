# Machine-Learning-Practice
These are a collection of assignments and tutorials I have completed. <br/>

* **cond_gaussian_naive_bayes.ipynb**: From-scratch implementation of a conditional gaussian classifier, and naive bayes classifier, on the MNIST data. For my ELEC-425 course.

* **neural_net_from_scratch.ipynb**: From-scratch implementation of a simple neural network (back-prop is also done from scratch). Used for XOR classification. For my CISC-867 Deep Learning course.

* **neural_net_from_scratch_mnist.ipynb**: Similar implementation of a neural network, but used to classify digits from MNIST. I also demonstrate what happens if we have large initial weights. For my CISC-867 Deep Learning course.
